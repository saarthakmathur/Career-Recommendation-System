# 🎯 Career Recommendation System using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning–based system that predicts the most suitable career for a student based on skills, academic performance, and interests using classification algorithms.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Choosing the right career is a critical decision for students.  
This project uses Machine Learning models to analyze student attributes and recommend an appropriate career path.

Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated, and the best-performing model is selected based on accuracy.

This project is developed for academic learning and portfolio demonstration purposes.
